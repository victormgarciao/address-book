# Address book

Address Book where you can add, edit or remove contacts with firstname, lastname, email and country

**NOTE:** I would like to do all the tests but I have no time, it is going to be an issue for this project, however, there are some tests done (Button, Input and Label) so you can see the way this application is tested.

**NOTE:** This project is done with node v7.7.1 and I use yarn v0.21.3 as a depency manager, I would recommend to install them to the correct use of this project

**NOTE:** This project has been developed with Reactjs tech, also I have used the library [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) in order to have webpack, Label, etc configured.
